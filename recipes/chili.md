# Chili

## 2020.06.15

Made the version with ground beef, which turned out pretty good. The end result
was reminiscent of a sloppy joe-style chili, which is not my preference, so
next time, try short ribs or other chunked meat instead.

- 1/4 cup (60ml) strongly brewed coffee or espresso
- 1/2 ounce (15g) dark chocolate
- 1/2 teaspoon (3ml) Asian fish sauce
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 4 cups cooked and drained red kidney beans or two 15.5-ounce (439g) cans red

- Sour cream, cilantro leaves, thinly sliced fresh chili or jalapeño, grated

### Directions

1.
  - Heat oil in pressure cooker over medium-high heat (or, if using electric
    pressure cooker, using sauté setting), until shimmering. Add about 1/4 of
    the ground beef, stirring occasionally, until very well browned. Using a
    slotted spoon, remove browned beef from cooker and set aside. Drain all but
    1 tablespoon fat from cooker.

  - Season beef all over with salt. Heat oil in pressure cooker over
    medium-high heat (or, if using electric pressure cooker, using sauté
    setting), until shimmering. Working in batches, add short rib slabs and
    cook, turning, until well browned on the two largest sides. Transfer
    browned short ribs to a cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch chunks. Set
    aside.

1. Add onion and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from bottom of
   cooker, until lightly golden, about 5 minutes (cooking time will depend
   heavily on your pressure cooker, especially electric ones where you can't
   control the heat level). Season with salt. Stir in garlic, chili powder,
   onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper, and cook, stirring,
   until fragrant, about 1 minute. (Add more oil at any time if cooker seems
   too dry.) Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until slightly darkened,
   about 1 minute.

1. Return browned beef to cooker along with any accumulated juices. Add
   uncooked beef, crushed tomatoes, and stir well to combine. Season lightly
   with salt. Stir in coffee, chocolate, and fish sauce. Add bay leaf. Bring to
   a simmer, stirring well and scraping bottom all over. Using a wooden spoon
   or potato masher, break up any chunks of ground beef. Scrape bottom all over
   once more before sealing the cooker.

1. Seal cooker, bring to high pressure, and cook for 20 minutes. Quick-release
   cooker and stir chili well, scraping bottom to make sure nothing is
   sticking.

1. Discard bay leaf. Stir in drained beans. Season with salt and plenty of
   black pepper. Taste chili and add more chili powder, cumin, or cayenne
   pepper to taste, if desired. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5
   minutes. If chili is too thick, stir in some reserved tomato juices (or
   bean-cooking liquid, if you have it) to thin to desired consistency. If
   chili is too thin, simmer until thickened to desired consistency.

1. Serve with the toppings of your choice.
