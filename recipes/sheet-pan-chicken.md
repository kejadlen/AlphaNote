# Sheet-Pan Chicken

## 2020.07.05

Scaled the recipe down to a quarter sheet pan, so one potato and the dark meat
from one chicken. Used an onion since it's the allium we had on hand. Potatoes
and chicken were great, but I would skip the sauce next time - it was more work
than it was worth.

## [Sheet-Pan Chicken Thighs With Potatoes, Fennel, and Mustard-Beer Sauce Recipe][serious-eats]

- Yield: Serves 4 to 8
- Active time: 30 minutes
- Total time: 1 hour 15 minutes

### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds (680g; about 3 large) Yukon gold potatoes, sliced crosswise into
  1/8-inch-thick rounds
- 1 large (1 pound; 450g) bulb fennel, stalks, and root end trimmed and bulb
  sliced lengthwise 1/8-inch-thick, fronds reserved
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 pounds/1.3kg; see note)
- 4 ounces (115g) sharp white Cheddar cheese, finely grated, preferably with a
  Microplane grater
- One (12-ounce; 355ml) can lager, pilsner, or pale ale
- 3 tablespoons (45ml) stone-ground (coarse) mustard
- 1 teaspoon sugar, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) and set rack in upper-middle position. In
   large mixing bowl, toss potatoes and fennel with olive oil. Season lightly
   with salt and pepper.

1. On a rimmed baking sheet, arrange potatoes and fennel in even layers that
   are slightly overlapping, covering the entire surface of the baking sheet.
   You can try to make a pretty scalloped pattern, though it's not essential
   that the design be beautiful.

1. Season chicken all over with salt and pepper. Arrange chicken along outer
   edges of the sheet pan, making sure there's a thigh covering every corner
   (the baking sheet gets hottest at the edges and corners, so placing chicken
   there will keep the potatoes below from scorching).

1. Bake chicken and vegetables until chicken skin is golden and crispy, about
   45 minutes. Transfer chicken thighs to warm serving platter or plates and
   keep warm.

1. Scatter grated cheese all over the surface of the potatoes and fennel. Turn
   the oven to broiler mode. Broil until cheese is melted and turning lightly
   golden in spots and vegetables grow slightly more crisp and brown on the
   surface, about 5 minutes.

1. Using a slotted spatula, carefully transfer potatoes and fennel to serving
   platter or plates, allowing excess fat to drain before each transfer. You
   can stack vegetables on top of each other to create a taller gratin-like
   structure. Keep warm.

1. Set baking sheet over stovetop burner set to medium-high heat. Cook, moving
   the baking sheet around as needed, to brown remnant cooking juices on the
   bottom of the baking sheet; be careful not to accidentally burn your
   potholder or kitchen towel as you maneuver the baking sheet around over the
   flame. Also don't be alarmed if your baking sheet buckles; this can happen
   when it undergoes big temperature shifts, and we've always found they return
   to their normal flat shape soon.

1. Drain excess fat on the baking sheet into a small heatproof bowl. Return
   baking sheet to heat and immediately add beer. Increase heat to high and
   bring beer to boil. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up the browned bits on the
   bottom of the baking sheet.

1. Stir in mustard, using wooden spoon. Work mustard into the beer while
   carefully shaking the baking sheet to mix the thin layer of liquid on it.
   Continue to cook, stirring and gently shaking, until reduced by about half.
   Stir in sugar. Turn off heat and melt in butter, stirring and shaking the
   whole time to emulsify it into the sauce. Taste, then season with salt
   and/or more sugar, as desired. Pour sauce into serving boat. Garnish
   potatoes with reserved fennel fronds and serve.
