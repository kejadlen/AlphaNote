## [Serious Eats 3-Ingredient Stovetop Macaroni and Cheese][serious-eats]

[serious-eats]: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/01/3-ingredient-stovetop-mac-and-cheese-recipe.html

- Yield: Serves 2
- Active Time: 8 minutes
- Total Time: 8 minutes

### Ingredients

- 6 ounces (170g) elbow macaroni
- Salt
- 6 ounces (180ml) evaporated milk
- 6 ounces (170g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good melting
  cheese, such as Fontina, Gruy√®re, or Jack

### Directions

1. Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold
   water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat,
   stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost
   completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.

1. Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat
   to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid
   has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with
   more salt and serve immediately.
