title: 'How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They''re Built'
author: Stewart Brand
notes:
- location: 3%
  highlight: Almost no buildings adapt well. They’re designed not to adapt; also budgeted
    and financed not to, constructed not to, administered not to, maintained not to,
    regulated and taxed not to, even remodeled not to. But all buildings (except monuments)
    adapt anyway, however poorly, because the usages in and around them are changing
    constantly.
- location: 4%
  highlight: In wider use, the term “architecture” always means “unchanging deep structure.”
    It is an illusion. New usages persistently retire or reshape buildings.
- location: 4%
  highlight: The word “building” contains the double reality. It means both “the action
    of the verb BUILD” and “that which is built”—both verb and noun, both the action
    and the result. Whereas “architecture” may strive to be permanent, a “building”
    is always building and rebuilding. The idea is crystalline, the fact fluid. Could
    the idea be revised to match the fact?

    Chicago highrise designer,"

    shape us.”

  highlight: Commercial buildings are forever metamorphic.
- location: 5%
  highlight: Domestic buildings—homes—are the steadiest changers, responding directly
    to the family’s ideas and annoyances, growth and prospects.
- location: 5%
  highlight: Institutional buildings act as if they were designed specifically to
    prevent change for the organization inside and to convey timeless reliability
    to everyone outside. When forced to change anyway, as they always are, they do
    so with expensive reluctance and all possible delay. Institutional buildings are
    mortified by change.

  highlight: A FIX BECOMES A FEATURE. Add-ons often become a distinctive part of a
    generic building type.
  note: We see this a lot with patterns blindly applied across codebases even when
    the original reasons have long since stopped being applicable.

  highlight: There is a universal rule—never acknowledged because its action is embarrassing

    continuity and constraint.

  highlight: Small lots will support resilience because they allow many people to
    attend directly to their needs by designing, building, and maintaining their own

    greater efficiency by their sheer expense—30 percent of operating costs, equal
    over a building’s life to the entire original cost of construction.

  highlight: An adaptive building has to allow slippage between the differently-paced
    systems of Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space plan, and Stuff.

    time it is the opposite, and destructive as well.

  highlight: "“Things that are good have a certain kind of structure,” he told me.
    “You can’t get that structure except dynamically. Period. In nature you’ve got
    continuous very-small-feedback-loop adaptation going on, which is why things get
    to be harmonious. That’s why they have the qualities that we value."

  highlight: "“What does it take to build something so that it’s really easy to make
    comfortable little modifications in a way that once you’ve made them, they feel
    integral with the nature and structure of what is already there? You want to be
    able to mess around with it and progressively change it to bring it into an adapted
    state with yourself, your family, the climate, whatever."

  highlight: Age plus adaptivity is what makes a building come to be loved. The building
    learns from its occupants, and they learn from it.

    space. Thus the building has a lot of personality. Also it’s nice to be in a building
    that has such prestige.”"

  highlight: Temporary is permanent, and permanent is temporary. Grand, final-solution
    buildings obsolesce and have to be torn down because they were too overspecified

    (“The bridge is at a comfortable angle”), the sensible parts kept, the humorous

  highlight: Most owner-builders take inordinate lengths of time to complete their
    projects; Jefferson took fifty-four years. Many owner-builders construct dwellings
    larger than necessary; Jefferson, a widower, built a thirty-five-room mansion.
    Owner-builders invariably extemporize as they build, adding to and modifying their
    original design as the house grows. Jefferson built one house, tore much of it
    down, doubled its size, and continued to alter, remodel, improve, and add to it
    for decades. It is a wonder that the house was ever finally completed; many thought
    it never would be.

  highlight: A frozen bureaucracy and a frozen building reinforce each other’s resistance
    to change. Change is obligatory, since bureaucracies always grow, but responsibility
    is dispersed and delayed in a maze of anxious responsibility-avoidance, and the
    building sits heavy and inert. Near any institutional building more than a decade
    old, you are likely to find a host of clumsy Low Road expediencies—trailers, temporary
    add-ons, people working in windowless storage rooms, space rented in nearby commercial
    buildings.

  highlight: The contractor passes 80 percent of the work to subcontractors. They
    are often the ones with the cutting-edge technical skills, but they are too far
    downstream to affect design. Once the building is finished, it is turned over
    to facilities managers who will actually run the building. They of course have
    had no hand in its design.

  highlight: Chris Alexander likes to make on-site adjustment to a building as it’s
    being constructed. “Architects are supposed to be good visualizers, and we are,”
    he says, “but still, most of the time we’re wrong. Even when you build the things
    yourself and you’re doing good, you’re still making nine mistakes for every success.
    So you take the time to correct them. The more at each stage you can approach
    being able to experience the contemplated reality, the more it will give you feedback
    and you’ll be able to intelligently develop it.”
- location: 25%
  highlight: "“Architects think of a building as a complete thing, while builders
    think of it and know it as a sequence—hole, then foundation, framing, roof, etc.
    The separation of design from making has resulted in a built environment that
    has no ‘flow’ to it—you simply cannot design an improvisation or an adaptation.
    It’s dead.”"

    people who are going to use the building six weeks before it opens, to record
    their expectations. That gives you a very interesting base. You should go back
    within the first six months, when they’re still fresh on the place and really
    feeling all the uneasy elements. Then you should go back about two years later,
    after they’ve accommodated themselves to the building. It would be wonderful to
    do a fourth one maybe ten years later, because by then the world has changed.
    Has your building been able to accommodate that change?”"

    hide-and-seek between remodelers, both amateur and professional, and the enforcers
    of codes—the building inspectors.

  highlight: The result is a mixed bag. Certainly more constant adjustment to buildings
    comes from all this informality, but every carpenter I’ve talked to complains
    that the thing they most dread in any remodeling job is shoddy prior work done
    on the sly and not up to code—“cob work done by some handyman.” They contract
    to fix a warped bathroom floor and find they have to completely redo the plumbing,
    wiring, walls, and floor joists because earlier slapdash work put in hazardous
    wiring and leaky, rot-producing pipes.
