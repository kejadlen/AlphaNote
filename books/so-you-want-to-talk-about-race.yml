title: So You Want to Talk About Race
author: Ijeoma Oluo
notes:
- location: 2%
  highlight: I have never been able to escape the fact that I am a black woman in
    a white supremacist country.
- location: 3%
  highlight: My white friends (having grown up in Seattle, the majority of my friends
    were white), some of whom I’d known since high school, were not happy with the
    real me.

  highlight: I hope that if parts of this book make you uncomfortable, you can sit
    with that discomfort for a while, to see if it has anything else to offer you.

  highlight: 'And although I’m tired, because I have just had this conversation with
    multiple people for multiple hours the evening before, here I am having it again,
    hearing what I’ve always heard: the problem in American society is not race, it’s
    class.'
- location: 6%
  highlight: "“Why do you think black people are poor? Do you think it’s for the same
    reasons that white people are?”"
- location: 6%
  highlight: "“That’s the promise that’s been made to us for hundreds of years. Those
    are the words of every labor movement that managed to help white America so much
    more than everyone else. Those are the words that ‘move everybody forward’ but
    in the exact same place, with the exact same hierarchy, and the exact same oppressions.
    Those words are why the wealth gap between whites and blacks is just as bad as
    it was when Dr. King was leading marches. We’re still waiting. We’re still hoping.
    We’re still left behind.”"

  highlight: Money is also a social construct—a series of rules and agreements we
    all made up while pretending that these pieces of paper are worth our entire lives.
    But we cannot simply stop thinking of money and it will cease to enthrall us.
- location: 7%
  highlight: White Supremacy is this nation’s oldest pyramid scheme. Even those who
    have lost everything to the scheme are still hanging in there, waiting for their
    turn to cash out.

  highlight: But the same hammer won’t tear down all of the walls.
- location: 8%
  highlight: because we have come up in a society where talking about race is just
    not something you “do” in polite company, we don’t have a lot of practice in putting
    words to racial issues.
- location: 8%
  highlight: 1. It is about race if a person of color thinks it is about race. 2.
    It is about race if it disproportionately or differently affects people of color.
    3. It is about race if it fits into a broader pattern of events that disproportionately
    or differently affect people of color.
- location: 8%
  highlight: She too is making it about race whether she knows it or not.
- location: 9%
  highlight: racial exceptionalism of people of color does not detract from, but instead
    adds to, arguments of racial inequality
- location: 9%
  highlight: Disadvantaged white people are not erased by discussions of disadvantages
    facing people of color, just as brain cancer is not erased by talking about breast
    cancer. They are two different issues with two different treatments, and they
    require two different conversations.
- location: 10%
  highlight: Often, being a person of color in white-dominated society is like being
    in an abusive relationship with the world.
- location: 11%
  highlight: Race alone is not all you need to focus on, but without it, any solution
    you come up with just won’t work.
- location: 11%
  highlight: But race is not a universal experience.
- location: 12%
  highlight: 'Note: “people like you” is a good warning that a conversation is about
    to head into pretty racist territory.'
- location: 12%
  highlight: Believe it or not, I, like most people, really do just want to live in
    peace and not have four-hour-long arguments about race and poverty on the Internet.
- location: 12%
  highlight: It seemed far more important to him that the white people who were spreading
    and upholding racism be spared the effects of being called racist, than sparing
    his black friend the effects of that racism.
- location: 13%
  highlight: 'For the purposes of this book, I’m going to use the second definition
    of racism: a prejudice against someone based on race, when those prejudices are
    reinforced by systems of power.'
- location: 13%
  highlight: It’s the system, and our complacency in that system, that gives racism
    its power, not individual intent.
- location: 14%
  highlight: Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or
    not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have
    to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.
- location: 14%
  highlight: But when I look at what is putting me and millions of other people of
    color at risk, a lack of niceness from white people toward me and people who look
    like me is very far down the list of priorities.
- location: 14%
  highlight: We cannot fix these systemic issues on a purely emotional basis.
- location: 15%
  highlight: The ultimate goal of racism was the profit and comfort of the white race,
    specifically, of rich white men.
- location: 15%
  highlight: If this happens, it is pretty obvious that you aren’t actually having
    a conversation and it is probably best to walk away and maybe try again later
    if productive conversation is actually your goal.
- location: 15%
  highlight: This is a great way to let that person know that you do hear them, and
    that your experiences do not erase theirs because even though their experience
    is valid, it is a different experience.
- location: 17%
  highlight: Quite often, well-meaning white people will attempt to show me how much
    they “get it” by launching into racial dialogues filled with assumptions, stereotypes,
    and microaggressions that they are completely unaware of.
- location: 18%
  highlight: And here is where I shouted “NOOOOOO!” like in those movie scenes where
    your buddy is about to open a car door that will so obviously set off a bomb that
    will kill him.
- location: 19%
  highlight: it’s our desire to ignore race that increases the necessity of its discussion.
- location: 20%
  highlight: YOU’RE GOING TO SCREW THIS UP. You’re going to screw this up royally.
    More than once.
- location: 20%
  highlight: Remember what your top priority in the conversation is, and don’t let
    your emotions override that.
- location: 20%
  highlight: But it is never okay to battle racism with sexism, transphobia, ableism,
    or other oppressive language and actions.
- location: 21%
  highlight: If you are white, watch how many times you say “I” and “me.”
- location: 21%
  highlight: 'Ask yourself: Am I trying to be right, or am I trying to do better?'
- location: 21%
  highlight: Stop trying to jump back in when a conversation is beyond saving.
- location: 21%
  highlight: Apologize.
- location: 21%
  highlight: Don’t insist that people give you credit for your intentions.
- location: 22%
  highlight: Don’t beat yourself up.
- location: 22%
  highlight: Racial oppression should always be an emotional topic to discuss. It
    should always be anger-inducing.
- location: 25%
  highlight: very few people actually know what privilege is, let alone how they would
    go about checking it.
- location: 25%
  highlight: Privilege, in the social justice context, is an advantage or a set of
    advantages that you have that others do not.
- location: 27%
  highlight: We want to know that if we do “a” we can expect “b,” and that those who
    never get “b” have never done “a.”
- location: 27%
  highlight: When we are willing to check our privilege, we are not only identifying
    areas where we are perpetuating oppression in order to stop personally perpetuating
    that oppression, but we are also identifying areas where we have the power and
    access to change the system as a whole.
- location: 27%
  highlight: I recommend practicing looking for your privilege at first when you are
    in a neutral situation.
- location: 28%
  highlight: You may well want to list your disadvantages as well. This is not the
    time for that, so please resist the urge.
- location: 28%
  highlight: failing to check my own privilege means that my efforts to fight racism
    and sexism would leave out many of the women and people of color I claim to be
    fighting for. I march for black people, but am I marching for black trans women,
    disabled black people, incarcerated black people as well?
- location: 28%
  highlight: Being privileged doesn’t mean that you are always wrong and people without
    privilege are always right—it means that there is a good chance you are missing
    a few very important pieces of the puzzle.
- location: 28%
  highlight: know that you have unexamined privilege too, no matter how woke you think
    you are—

  highlight: Someone is giving you an opportunity to do better, no matter how unpleasant
    the delivery. Thank them.

    of Twitter trolls who think I hate black men before this shit goes viral and I
    can never use Twitter again.”"

  highlight: Hotep Twitter (think black men’s rights activists with the added fun
    of wildly inaccurate Egyptian origin mythology, on Twitter),

  highlight: Twitter is a huge tool in finding and maintaining my audience,
- location: 30%
  highlight: I simply could not afford to be pushed off of that platform.
- location: 31%
  highlight: Nobody marches for us.
- location: 31%
  highlight: Because I am not capable of cutting myself to pieces. I’m not capable
    of cutting away my blackness in order to support feminism that views the needs
    of women of color as divisive inconveniences. I’m not capable of cutting away
    womanhood in order to stand by black men who prey on black women.
- location: 32%
  highlight: Because the needs of the most privileged are usually the ones prioritized,
    they are often the only ones considered when discussing solutions to oppression
    and inequality.
- location: 32%
  highlight: Intersectionality helps ensure that fewer people are left behind and
    that our efforts to do better for some do not make things far worse for others.

  highlight: So he doesn’t ask anymore, and after seeing what happened to Sandra Bland,
    I certainly don’t ask either.
- location: 35%
  highlight: But it does not put us at risk equally, and the numbers bear that out.
    My fear, as a black driver, is real. The fact is that black drivers are 23 percent
    more likely to be pulled over than white drivers1, between 1.5 and 5 times more
    likely to be searched (while shown to be less likely than whites to turn up contraband
    in these searches),2 and more likely to be ticketed3 and arrested4 in those stops.
    This increase in stops, searches, and arrests also leads to a 3.5–4 times higher
    probability that black people will be killed by cops (this increase is the same
    for Native Americans interacting with police, a shamefully underreported statistic).
    Even when we aren’t arrested or killed, we are still more likely to be abused
    and dehumanized in our stops. A 2016 review of a thirteen-month period showed
    that Oakland police handcuffed 1,466 black people in nonarrest traffic stops,
    and only 72 white people5, and a 2016 study by the Center for Policing Equity
    found that blacks were almost 4 times more likely to be subject to force from
    police—including force by hand (such as hitting and choking), pepper spray, tazer,
    and gun—than white people.6
- location: 37%
  highlight: In this individualist nation we like to believe that systemic racism
    doesn’t exist. We like to believe that if there are racist cops, they are individual
    bad eggs acting on their own. And with this belief, we are forced to prove that
    each individual encounter with the police is definitively racist or it is tossed
    out completely as mere coincidence.
- location: 37%
  highlight: Our early American police forces existed not only to combat crime, but
    also to return black Americans to slavery and control and intimidate free black
    populations.
- location: 38%
  highlight: Our police force was not created to serve black Americans; it was created
    to police black Americans and serve white Americans.
- location: 38%
  highlight: This is not to say that the majority of our police officers are racist,
    hateful monsters.
- location: 38%
  highlight: This implicit bias against people of color is so insidious that not even
    people of color are exempt from having it, which is why, yes, even police officers
    of color can show bias against civilians of color.
- location: 39%
  highlight: When an officer shoots an unarmed black man and says he feared for his
    life, I believe it. But that fear itself is often racist and unfounded.
- location: 39%
  highlight: We don’t call crime that happens in white communities “white-on-white”
    crime, even though the majority of crimes against white people are perpetrated
    by other white people.
- location: 39%
  highlight: Nobody wants a solution to crime in black communities more than black
    people do, they are the people most impacted by it. But when you cannot trust
    the police to protect you, who do you call to report illegal activity? When a
    crime happens, why would you cooperate with a police force that you do not trust
    to enforce the law without bias or excessive force?

  highlight: After I left that interview, a manager from a neighboring team came up
    to me and asked, plainly and without shame, “Are you leaving because of all of
    the times that I sexually harassed you?”

  highlight: Social media had broken down traditional publishing barriers as readers
    clamored for authentic voices on important social issues.

  highlight: I think about every black and brown person, every queer person, every
    disabled person, who could be in the room with me, but isn’t, and I’m not proud.
    I’m heartbroken. We should not have a society where the value of marginalized
    people is determined by how well they can scale often impossible obstacles that
    others will never know. I have been exceptional, and I shouldn’t have to be exceptional
    to be just barely getting by.
- location: 47%
  highlight: the majority of the costs and benefits of affirmative action are easily
    supported by data, and the arguments against it are easily countered.
- location: 49%
  highlight: In truth, even if implemented across the public and private sectors,
    even if vigorously enforced, affirmative action will never be more than a Band-Aid
    on a festering sore as long as it’s still just trying to correct the end effects
    of systemic racism.

  highlight: Cracker does not invoke the mass lynchings of white people, “blacks only”
    lunch counters, snarling police dogs aimed at white bodies—because that simply
    did not happen in our history.
- location: 57%
  highlight: This is why, even if some of these words have been “reclaimed” by some
    in the community they were used to oppress, when these words are used by white
    people, that use will continue to be abusive.

  highlight: No, you are free to say just about anything you want in a country with
    free speech.

  highlight: A lot of people want to skip ahead to the finish line of racial harmony.
- location: 57%
  highlight: But words only lose their power when first the impact of those words
    are no longer felt, not the other way around.
- location: 57%
  highlight: It is completely fair that a word used to help create and maintain the
    oppression of others for your benefit would not be able to be used by you without
    invoking that oppression, while people of color who had never had the power to
    oppress with those words would be able to use them without invoking that same
    oppression.

  highlight: We can broadly define the concept of cultural appropriation as the adoption
    or exploitation of another culture by a more dominant culture.
- location: 59%
  highlight: These sentiments are certainly understandable, but they err in conflating
    appreciation with appropriation.
- location: 59%
  highlight: The problem of cultural appropriation is primarily linked to the power
    imbalance between the culture doing the appropriating and the culture being appropriated.
    That power imbalance allows the culture being appropriated to be distorted and
    redefined by the dominant culture and siphons any material or financial benefit
    of that piece of culture away to the dominant culture, while marginalized cultures
    are still persecuted for living in that culture.

  highlight: But when all you can take is the art, and you can take the enjoyment
    and the profit and the recognition—and you can’t take any of the pain or the history
    or the struggle, can you do so and honestly call it rap if you love it at all?
- location: 61%
  highlight: Until we do live in a society that equally respects all cultures, any
    attempts of the dominant culture to “borrow” from marginalized cultures will run
    the risk of being exploitative and insulting.
- location: 61%
  highlight: What is offensive to one person in a marginalized culture, is not offensive
    to another.
- location: 61%
  highlight: And this is where the anxiety lies, because when you are trying to not
    appropriate a culture, but also trying to live in a diverse world, it can be hard
    to know what is or is not going to offend.

  highlight: Our hair is used to help determine our place in a white supremacist society.
- location: 68%
  highlight: Because each microaggression is just one sting perpetrated by a different
    person, it is hard to address with each individual person without (1) becoming
    very exhausted, and (2) being written off as hypersensitive.

  highlight: our children took that freedom to high school and college and they realized
    how little difference our striving has made to the outlook on their futures.

  highlight: No matter what our intentions, everything we say and do in the pursuit
    of justice will one day be outdated, ineffective, and yes, probably wrong. That
    is the way progress works.

  highlight: I hope to give a platform, a foundation for our young people to build
    upon and then smash to bits when it is no longer needed.

  highlight: When we say “Asian American” we are talking about so much more than can
    be fit in a single stereotype.
- location: 80%
  highlight: This makes it very hard for Asian Americans to complain about racist
    microaggressions against them, and makes it even harder for them to be taken seriously
    when they do.
- location: 81%
  highlight: But a quieter, gentler voice did not bring a quieter, gentler world.
    All it did was give people the impression that I was okay with living like a second-class
    citizen. All it did was increase my burden.

    that is all you should need to know in order to stand by my side.

  highlight: Tone policing prioritizes the comfort of the privileged person in the
    situation over the oppression of the disadvantaged person.

  highlight: Most damagingly, tone policing places prerequisites on being heard and
    being helped.
- location: 83%
  highlight: To refuse to listen to someone’s cries for justice and equality until
    the request comes in a language you feel comfortable with is a way of asserting
    your dominance over them in the situation.

  highlight: When I asked a group of people of color what they feared most when talking
    about racism, their number-one concern was retaliation.

  highlight: You are, at times, kind and mean, generous and selfish, witty and dull.
    Sometimes you are all of these things at once. And if you are white in a white
    supremacist society, you are racist. If you are male in a patriarchy, you are
    sexist. If you are able-bodied, you are ableist. If you are anything above poverty
    in a capitalist society, you are classist. You can sometimes be all of these things
    at once.
- location: 87%
  highlight: Because you have been racist, and you have been anti-racist. Yes, you
    may now be insisting that you do not have a racist bone in your body, but that
    is simply not true. You have been racist, and will be in the future, even if less
    so.
- location: 88%
  highlight: This is real harm that has been done and you have to accept that if you
    do not want to continue harming people by denying their lived experiences and
    denying your responsibility. This does not mean that you have to flog yourself
    for all eternity.

  highlight: Talk. Please talk and talk and talk some more. But also act. Act now,
    because people are dying now in this unjust system.
