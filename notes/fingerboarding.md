## The Moves

### Hang Board Climbing Simulation

What it does: Mimics the finger stresses of climbing and serves as a good
warm-up for strength-specific finger exercises.

How to do it: Place a sturdy chair or stool on the ground just behind the hang
board (the farther away it is, the more difficult this will be, since it
simulates steeper climbing). Grab the jugs or large holds, place your feet up
on the chair, then “climb” on the hang board as you would on a climbing wall:
let go with one hand, reach toward the ceiling or out to the side, and return
to a different grip. Try to mimic the movement of climbing as best as possible.
Repeat with the other hand, aiming for 60 to 80 percent effort. Use different
types of holds and edge depths for variety and to change the intensity.

Volume: Complete sets of 10 to 15 moves, with two to three minutes of rest
between each set. Continue on and off for 45 to 60 minutes total. “It’s not as
fun as climbing, but if you’re stuck at home and bored, this is a really
effective use of time,” says Nelson. “With short sessions, more experienced
climbers can also train their fingers again later in the day.”

### Lock-Off Repeaters

What they do: Strengthen the body’s big pulling muscles—the lats, biceps,
shoulders, and upper back—through isometric holds.

How to do them: Grab a pull-up bar or the jugs on a hang board, with your palms
facing away. Engage your shoulders and core, then pull up until your elbows are
bent 90 degrees. Hold for five seconds, then lower until your arms are
straight, keeping your shoulders engaged to protect the joints. Complete
another set with your arms bent to 120 degrees. If this is too challenging, use
a resistance band for assistance: girth-hitch one end around the pull-up bar,
and place your knee in the bottom of the loop to take the weight off your arms.
If it’s too easy, wear a weighted vest or your harness with weights hung from
it.

Volume: Two sets (one at 90 degrees, one at 120 degrees) of five reps (five
seconds on, three seconds off), with one to three minutes of rest between sets.

### One-Arm Recruitment Pulls

What they do: Train maximum finger strength by forcing motor units to fire in
unison.

How to do them: Find an edge size on the hang board that will work for your
finger strength. Beginners should aim for around 20 millimeters; experts, 15 to
10 millimeters. Stand underneath the hang board, reach overhead with one arm to
grab the edge using either an open hand or a half-crimp grip, then pull down
with 100 percent effort for three to five seconds. It’s OK if your feet stay on
the ground, says Nelson, as long as you’re pulling with maximal effort. Keep
your elbow bent at a large angle (120 to 150 degrees) and not completely
extended during the pull. Repeat with the other arm.

If that’s too easy, do a one-arm hang with your feet off the ground: find an
edge depth that allows you to hang for around five seconds before hitting
failure. Wear your harness and hang additional weight off it if necessary.

Volume: Three (beginners) to five (experts) repetitions for each grip (open
hand and half crimp) on each hand. Rest for one to two minutes. For expert
climbers, complete a second set.

### Density Hangs

What they do: Strengthen the flexor tendons and muscles of the fingers to help
make them more resilient against injury and allow you to climb and train at a
higher intensity.

How to do them: Find an edge size on the hang board that you can hang from with
both hands for approximately 20 to 40 seconds, then do so, keeping your
shoulders engaged, until failure. Beginners should use two grip positions: open
hand and half crimp. Experts should use three positions: open hand, half crimp,
and full crimp. (Based on your strengths and weaknesses, you might need to use
different edges for each hand position.)

Once you can hang for 30 seconds easily, progress by switching to a smaller
edge. For advanced climbers without a smaller option, don and add weight to a
harness.

Volume: One (beginners) to two (experts) sets of two to three repetitions per
grip. Rest for three to five minutes between hangs.

### Front-Lever Progression

What it does: Trains climbing-specific core strength, targeting deep-core
muscles, abs, your back, obliques, and hip flexors.

How to do it: Grab a pull-up bar or the jugs on a hang board, with your palms
facing away. Engage your shoulders and core, then pull up until your elbows are
bent to 90 degrees. Keep your body completely straight from heel to head, then
lean back as you raise your legs to enter a partial front lever. Go as far as
you can while maintaining a rigid plank form, whether that’s only a few degrees
back or a full front lever with your body parallel to the floor. Focus on
breathing in this position. Hold for five seconds, then lower and rest for
three seconds.

Volume: One to two sets of five seconds on, three seconds off, for five to
seven repetitions.

## The Workout

Allow time for at least a 15-to-20-minute warm-up before diving into the
workout. Try to match the volume and intensity of your climbing-gym routine as
much as possible, starting with easy boulder problems or routes, resting
between each, and gradually increasing the difficulty until you’re ready to
roll. Jog or jump-rope to raise your heart rate, then do a set or two of
pull-ups and burpees to get your big muscle groups fired up. Then do short,
easy hangs (five seconds on, ten seconds off) to warm up your fingers.

Once you’ve warmed up, transition to the workout. If you’re a sport climber,
aim for shorter rests between sets--around 15 seconds to a minute—to emphasize
endurance and capacity training. If you’re a boulderer, use longer rests—two to
four minutes, or as long as you need to reach full recovery—to focus on maximal
strength and power. If you normally have a mobility or stretching routine, feel
free to add that to the mix as well.

Beginner climbers should aim to do four training sessions per week. Split the
recruitment pulls and density hangs between different days, separated by at
least two days. Experienced climbers can realistically knock out eight training
sessions per week, splitting climbing and finger sessions between mornings and
evenings.
