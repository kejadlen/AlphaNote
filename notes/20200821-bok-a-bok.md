# Bok a Bok

## 2020.08.21

This was about the right amount of food for us, though maybe a little too
carb-heavy. It's also pretty much just a deconstructed Bowl of Shame.

- **Dirty Tots**: Traveled surprisingly well. The egg has a perfect gooey
  consistency.
- **Kimchi Mac n Cheese**: Pasta holds up very well to the sauce. Could use
  more kimchi, but delicious nonetheless.
- **OG Wings**: Nice that it's a dry wing. Would opt for a different sauce than
  the Sesame Soy Garlic next time.
