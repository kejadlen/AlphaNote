- Session (Acceleration **OR** Maximum Velocity)
  - Acceleration
    - 10m acceleration with a walk-in start
      - Then take 1 minute rest, and repeat 5 times
    - 20m acceleration from a 2 point start
      - Then take 90 seconds rest, and repeat 4 times
    - 30m acceleration from a 3 point start
      - Then take 90 seconds rest, and repeat 4 times 
  - Maximum Velocity
    - We call this workout a build-up - where we gradually increase speed,
      going through ‘our gears’, from 1st, to 2nd, to 3rd, and up to whatever
      gear you have. Once you are at maximum speed, hold this for 20m, and then
      gradually slow down.
    - Each run will be 40-60m in length
    - It is important not to go further, as we will no longer be working on
      maximum speed, and instead are now working on endurance abilities!
    - Try to complete 5-8 of these, with 3-5 minutes rest. If 3-5 minutes of
      passive rest is too long for you, feel free to perform some core work in
      between
