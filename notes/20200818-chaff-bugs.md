# [Chaff Bugs: Deterring Attackers by Making Software Buggier][chaff-bugs]

[chaff-bugs]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00659

The short of it is pretty much this:

> Rather than eliminating bugs, we instead add large numbers of bugs that are
> provably (but not obviously) non-exploitable.

I'll admit I read this mainly because the concept is just amazing. There's lots
more technically around making sure the injected bugs aren't actually
exploitable, performance, and the economics of exploits.
