## Tuesday

- [Advances in UICollectionView](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10097/)
  - New in iOS 14
    - Expandable, collapsible outline
    - List
  - Data - Layout - Presentation
    - Data: `UICollectionViewDataSource` -> Diffable Data Source -> Section Snapshots
    - Layout: `UICollectionViewLayout` -> Compositional Layout -> List Configuration
    - Presentation: `UICollectionView(Cell|ReusableView)` -> List Cell + View Configuration
  - Section snapshots
  - Getting whiplash going between `UICollectionView` and `SwiftUI` sessions
    - Going to skip the other collection view sessions. (Career decision, since
      I don't know when I'll be working on iOS next, and I might miss out on
      needing to know about `UICollectionView` at all.)
  - List configuration + list layout
  - Modern cells
    - Cell registrations set up cell from view model
    - Cell layouts
- [Advances in diffable data sources](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10045/)
  - Now with section snapshots, and expand/contract
  - Are collection views going to replace table views?
- [Design for iPad](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10206/)
  - Sidebar navigation instead of tabbar
- [Introduction to SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10119/)
  - Nice overall intro, mostly stuff I was vaguely aware of already, but nice
    to see how to use it in a(n idealized) development flow
  - I wonder what implements `toggle()` on a `@State bool`?
  - Probably [Data Essentials in SwiftUI][data-essentials-in-swift-ui] would be
    more useful
  - Can you make computed observed properties?
  - Multiple previews with different size categories and automatically
    identifying localization strings in UI element text? Way to bury that lede
    in this session!
- [Lists in UICollectionView](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10026/)
- [Make your app visually accessible](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10020/)
  - Smart Invert vs. Dark Mode are specifically different use cases
  - Swapping stack view axes would've been easier to deal with than maintaining
    a horizontal axis w/large text.
  - Accessibility options I didn't know about:
    - Bold Text
    - Cross Fade (instead of Slide) transition
- [Meet Nearby Interaction](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10668/)
  - Distance + direction
  - Sensitive to orientation, direction only available within a specific
    conical FoV from the sensor
- [Modern Cell Configuration](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10027/)
- [Swan's Quest, Chapter 1: Voices in the dark](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10681/)
  - Specific for Playgrounds, but perhaps more broadly applicable for UIKit?
- [What's new in Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10143/)
- [What's new in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10170/)
  - Smaller binary size
  - Less heap used (better already from memory layout, but now smaller runtime size as well)
  - Better debugging, code completion (15x speed improvement)
  - Better code indentation
  - A bunch of language updates that I mostly don't care a lot about
  - Swift system API, OSLog, Numerics, ArgumentParser
  - StandardLibraryPreview package
- [What's new in SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10041/)
  - Watching mostly to see if this covers sidebars in SwiftUI
    - Seems like yes - maybe the book sample app?
    - Also maybe see [Optimize the interface of your Mac Catalyst app][10056]
    - "Tab window" for tabs without documents (`WindowGroup`)?
  - `App` -> `Scene` -> `View` (see [App essentials in SwiftUI][10037])
  - Widgets, complications
  - Lists, collections
    - Lazy grids!
  - Toolbars, controls
    - Semantic placements
  - Impressive handling of dynamic type by SwiftUI's `LabelView`s
    - A one-liner with a leading icon gets leading padding when it goes
      multi-line, and then removes the leading padding at larger text sizes
      when you need every last bit of space
- [What's new in location](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10660/)

# Friday

- [Accessibility design for Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10117/)
- [Advancements in the Objective-C runtime](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10163/)
- [Background execution demystified](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10063/)
  - Factors
    - Critically low battery
    - Low Power Mode
    - App usage (the more a user uses an app, the more importance it gets for background execution)
    - App switcher (only runs apps still in the app switcher)
    - Background App Refresh switch (applies to more than just background app refresh)
    - System budgets
      - Energy and data
    - Rate limiting
      - Background launch frequency, etc.
  - Background app refresh tasks
    - System budgets are where devs have the most influence - time and data
  - Background pushes
    - Alerts app, not necessarily user
    - Not gated on app usage
    - Rate limiting: delays delivery of some pushes (15 minute minimum?)
  - Background URLSession
    - `sessionSendsLaunchEvents` - tell app when finished
    - `isDiscretionary` - if the request needs to be kicked off immediately
      - Discretionary
        - No app usage requirements or rate limits
        - Launch events do take into account all factors, though
      - Non-discretionary
        - Only app switcher and system budgets apply
        - Launch events ignore app usage and rate limiting (since these were user-initiated)
  - Background processing task
    - Several minutes, intensive
    - Runs while plugged in
      - Ignore battery factors
    - Should be fine as long as the user has used the app in the past couple weeks
- [Become a Simulator expert](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10647/)
- [Boost performance and security with modern networking](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10111/)
- [Build localization-friendly layouts using Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10219/)
  - Avoid fixed widths, fixed spacing
  - Allow multiple lines
    - Double strings mode (can enable during preview or at runtime)
    - (Maybe I should be using preview more in Xcode?)
  - Auto-adjusting StackView using `systemLayoutSizeFitting`
  - Can open Accessibility Inspector from Xcode
  - Can use Xcode's Environment Overrides feature to control device from Xcode
  - Suggests using Auto Layout fix-its?!
    - Looks like there are better suggestions in Xcode 12
    - Localization warnings seem sensible
    - Are these new, or did these already exist in Xcode 11?
  - Forgot there's a grid view in macOS, but why not in iOS?
  - > Manual testing with native speakers is crucial
- [Data Essentials in SwiftUI][data-essentials-in-swift-ui]
  - Normal properties for data not mutated by the view
  - `@State`
    - transient data owned by the view
    - `$state` creates a **projection** that's a `@Binding`
  - `@Binding` (binds to a `@State` or another `@Binding`)
    - mutating data owned by another view
  - `@ObservableObject`
    - `objectWillChange` property publisher
    - "data dependency surface"
  - `@Published`
    - automatically works with `ObservableObject`
    - `projectedValue` is a `Publisher`
  - `@ObservedObject`
    - tracks `ObservableObject`
    - doesn't own the instance (lifecycle)
  - `@StateObject`
    - tied to lifecycle of view
  - `@EnvironmentObject`
    - like React contexts, pass dependency past intermediate views
  - derive bindings using `$` prefix
  - Views should be lightweight and inexpensive
    - Struct only used to create a rendering, short-lived
  - ... -> UI -(event)-> { ... } -(mutation)-> Source of Truth -(update)-> View -(render)-> UI -> ...
    - avoid slow updates
      - make view initialization cheap
        - avoid repeated heap allocation in views (use `@StateObject`)
      - make body a pure function
      - avoid assumptions
      - SwiftUI runs its closures on the main thread
  - Data lifetimes
    - Views
    - Scenes
      - multiple views (windows) into same source of truth
    - App
      - app-wide (**global**) source of truth
    - `*Storage` for persisting data past app lifetime
      - `SceneStorage`
      - `AppStorage` - uses `UserDefaults`
- [Diagnose performance issues with the Xcode Organizer](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10076/)
- [Eliminate animation hitches with XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10077/)
- [Formatters: Make data human-friendly](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10160/)
- [Identify trends with the Power and Performance API](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10057/)
- [SF Symbols 2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10207/)
- [Structure your app for SwiftUI previews](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10149/)
  - Previewing multiple files
    - Can pin previews, useful for changing subviews but seeing full context
    - Previews don't have to be tied to a specific view - can just make a separate preview
  - App life cycle
    - Avoiding expensive initialization
      - Can use debug gauges to see this
      - Use `@State` to only init data when it's needed
  - Sample data
    - Can use development assets to not ship with a release build
  - Structuring views
    - Translate rich data models into simple types as early as possible
      - More testable
      - Minimum amount of data needed
      - I.e., don't pass in full CloudKit requirements
    - Immutable inputs
    - Mutable inputs
      - Use `@State` instead of full `@ObservedObject`
      - Pass in a closure to defer responsibility for actions
    - Generic inputs
      - Create a protocol for abstracting the dependency
      - Examples of dependency injection
    - Environment inputs
      - Pass data through environment, skipping intermediate views
      - Use `.environmentObject(...)` for the preview
  - `.constant`, `.constantPublisher` (for bindings?)
  - `.previewLayout(.sizeThatFits)`
- [The details of UI typography](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10175/)
  - Another really interesting talk, but not particularly useful until the
    second half (text styles and dynamic type) as a developer
  - Optical sizes
    - SF Text (small, <20 points) and SF Display (large, 20+ points)
    - Balance legibility against constraints (resolution, aesthetics, ...)
    - Vectors mean that the default is to use the same form for all sizes
  - Variable fonts
    - Each glyph can now scale and adapt in a more customized way
    - Transition to variable fonts from optical sized fonts
    - Works w/`preferredFont`, `systemFont` APIs
  - Tracking and leading
    - Tracking adds space between letters for layout
      - This is **not** kerning!
      - `allowsDefaultTighteningForTruncation`/`allowsTightening`
      - Enabled for 3rd party fonts
    - Leading (pronounced "ledding"): space between lines
      - Related to, but not, line-height?
  - Text styles and Dynamic Type
    - Text styles
      - `.preferredFont`
      - `.preferredFontDescriptor(...).withSymbolicTraits(...)` or `Font.(textStyle).(symbolicTrait)`
      - `withDesign` to round fonts, etc. or `Font.system(.body, design: .rounded)`
      - New `font-family` names
    - Dynamic Type
      - Custom fonts
        - `UIFontMetrics` (iOS 11)
        - SwiftUI
          - `Text("...").font(.custom("Font", size: 34, relativeTo: .title))`
            (defaults to scale relative to `body`)
          - `@ScaledMetric(relativeTo: .body)`
