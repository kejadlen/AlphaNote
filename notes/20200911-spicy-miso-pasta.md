# Spicy Miso Pasta

## 2020.09.11

Used penne and added a variety of vegetables from the CSA. It's actually pretty
similar to something I do with mac and cheese on occasion.

- Serves: 3 to 4
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Total Time: 30 minutes

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 ounces thick-cut or regular bacon, diced (about 1 cup)
- 3 tablespoons chili garlic sauce (or sambal oelek and ½ teaspoon chili flakes), plus more to taste
- 2 tablespoons blond or light miso, plus more to taste
- 2 tablespoons hot water
- 3 eggs
- ¾ pound dry spaghetti (or linguine or fettuccine)
- 2 ounces finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (about 1 ¼ cups), plus more for garnish
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ cup sliced scallion greens, plus more for garnish

### Directions

1. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a low boil, cover, and keep
   hot on a low burner. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large skillet, then
   add the bacon and cook until crisped and the fat is rendered, 9 to 10
   minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve.

1. In a bowl, whisk together the chili garlic sauce, miso, and hot water from
   boiling pot until smooth, then beat in the eggs. Cook the pasta according to
   box instructions until al dente and drain, reserving ½ cup of the pasta
   cooking water.

1. Add the pasta to the skillet with the bacon and toss to combine. Heat over
   medium heat until everything is nice and hot. Add the egg mixture, reduce
   the heat to low, and quickly toss until the eggs coat the pasta but aren’t
   scrambled. Add the cheese, pepper, and pasta water as desired until the
   sauce reaches your desired flavor and consistency. Taste, and add more chili
   garlic sauce if you like things spicy. Toss in the scallions. Divide among
   bowls, and garnish with more scallions and Parm.
