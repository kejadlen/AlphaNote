# Rosellini's

## 2020.10.04

- **Chocolate Chip Cookie**: Liked how un-fussy this is compared to other bakery cookies, which tend to be somewhat over-the-top.
- **Chocolate Almond Croissant**
- **Ham and Cheese Croissant**
- **Apple Turnover**: Wasn't appreciably better than the apple turnovers from the supermarket.
- **Lemon Meringue Tart**
