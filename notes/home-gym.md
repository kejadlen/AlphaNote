> Most places are sold out of equipment for a while; the common ones are Rogue
  (very solid equipment, USA-made, also expensive ... but not Sorinex-level
  expensive); Titan Fitness and Vulcan Fitness (I believe both are imported
  from China).

> EliteFTS was the big provider for powerlifting and bodybuilding before the
  CrossFit surge in late 2007-2012 timeframe, so they've been a bit forgotten
  about and have a good amount of equipment available compared to Rogue; very
  very solid equipment, it'd be tough to break.

> For a barbell Texas Power Bars are basically the gold-standard for the
  all-around (non-Olympic) bar, though Rogue and EliteFTS also have theirs
  which are close enough. Eleiko is an Olympics equipment provider and they
  can't be beat - quite quite expensive.

> Some gyms are loaning out equipment, others are going under, so Craigslist is
  an option, but as Ive seen in Austin, lots of scammers marking things up by
  over 100% of retail.

> For a garage setup, if you're doing deadlifts and dont want to risk your
  foundation ... you could do a deadlift platform (2 layers of plywood, and
  then 3/4" thick horse stall mats) for iron/steel plates, but for rubber
  coated bumper plates, you can get away with just the horse-stall mats.
  Tractor Supply Company has them, they're 4'x6' (0.75" thick) and are like
  $40. You want horse stall mats and not just rubber flooring, otherwise the
  rubber wont be thick enough, itll have too much give (giving you an unstable
  platform) and not distribute the load well enough to protect the foundation.

> Tykato Fitness has good info on maintaining/building grip strength at home
  (things like rice buckets)

> You can get some weights on craigslist, make sure youre getting 2" diameter
  Olympic plates and not the 1" diameter shitty plates, you wont be able to get
  a quality barbell to match.

> Expect $300-400 for a solid power bar, $400-1000 for squat stands with
  safeties or a full 4-post power-rack, and weights can vary in price based on
  used/new, calibrated or not, etc.

> A decent bench will be $100-200, dont need incline/decline tbh.

> A full rack can enable certain accessory lifts or setups that are harder on a
  squat stand (for example I have a double-pulley system with mine so I can do
  seated rows or tricep pushdowns); full racks are inherently more stable when
  it's not anchored in concrete, but that's mostly an issue of how much weight
  is used, if the squat stands have weight-posts on the base (which helps keeps
  things stable)
