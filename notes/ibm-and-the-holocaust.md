# IBM and the Holocaust

> IBM was self-gripped by a special amoral corporate mantra: if it can be done,
  it should be done. To the blind technocrat, the means were more important
  than the ends.

> Skipping around in the book will only lead to flawed and erroneous
  conclusions. So if you intend to skim, or rely on selected sections, please
  do not read the book at all.

> Only through exposing and examining what really occurred can the world of
  technology finally adopt the well-worn motto: Never Again.

> As for the moral dilemma, it simply did not exist for IBM. Supplying the
  Nazis with the technology they needed was not even debated. The company whose
  first overseas census was undertaken for Czar Nicholas II, the company
  Hollerith invented in his German image, the company war-profiteering Flint
  took global, the company built on Thomas J. Watson’s corrugated scruples,
  this company saw Adolf Hitler as a valuable trading ally.

> Dehomag needed to understand the most intimate details of the intended use,
  design the cards, and then create the codes.

> Each shift spanned 7.5 hours with 60 minutes allotted for “fresh air breaks”
  and a company-provided meal.

> “In using statistics, the government now has the road map to switch from
  knowledge to deeds.”

> “One thing which has greatly impressed me in connection with his leadership,”
  conceded Watson, “is the loyalty displayed by the people. To have the loyalty
  and cooperation of everyone means progress—and ultimate success for a nation
  or an individual business... we should pay tribute to Mussolini for
  establishing this spirit of loyal support and cooperation.”

> When Germany wanted to identify the Jews by name, IBM showed them how. When
  Germany wanted to use that information to launch pro-grams of social
  expulsion and expropriation, IBM provided the technologic wherewithal. When
  the trains needed to run on time, from city to city or between concentration
  camps, IBM offered that solution as well. Ultimately, 74 IBM AND THE
  HOLOCAUST there was no solution IBM would not devise for a Reich willing to
  pay for services rendered. One solution led to another. No solution was out
  of the question.

> The German Labor Front was the militant coalition responsible for mobilizing
  unemployed Nazi millions into both newly created jobs and vacated Jewish
  positions.

> “Children’s character is determined by their parents. Firms’ by their
  founders.”

> Each of the twenty-five floors in the imagined tower would be comprised of 12
  circular rooms representing one birth year. Every circular room would contain
  31 cabinets, one for each day of the month. Each cabinet would in turn
  contain 7,000 names.

> As the cross-indexing capabilities and sorting routines of Dehomag’s
  machinery became more sophisticated, race researchers continuously discovered
  greater informational depth about Jews and those of Jewish bloodline. For
  Dehomag, such statistical feats were both its science and its competitive
  edge. Educating its customers was an everyday occurrence.

> As a prime example, the journal cited “the field of medicine, and the science
  of genetics and race.”

> Eugenics became an elite cult. Nazis sought to weed out the weaker elements
  of its population, regardless of parentage---even from among their own
  people.

> One was The Law for Simplification of the Health System, enacted in July
  1934, requiring doctors and other clinicians to fill out detailed forms about
  the health condition of their patients.

> But now eugenic pseudo-academicians and Nazi statisticians evolved an
  additional belief that a man’s right to live was determined by his net worth
  to Nazi society.

> Hence, once an undesirable person was identified, the parents and offspring,
  including newborn children, required sterilization as well.

> Quickly, the notion of sterilizing the physically undesirable expanded to
  include the socially undesirable. So-called anti-socials, that is, misfits
  who seemed to be unsuited for labor, became special targets.

> But, “the numerically largest group consists of ‘the work-shy and habitual
  parasites.’”

> Yet, as a Dehomag notice to users advised, the questionnaires would have to
  be adapted to the technical demands of the Hollerith system, not the other
  way around.

> In the sterilization program’s first year, 1934, more than 84,600 cases
  brought to the Genetic Health Courts resulted in 62,400 forced
  sterilizations. In 1935, 88,100 genetic trials yielded 71,700 forced
  sterilizations.

> Depending upon the market, IBM derived as much as a third of its profit from
  card sales.

> In the Third Reich’s first years, Germany was completely dependent upon IBM
  NY for its punch cards. Even after the factory in Lichterfelde opened, German
  manufactured machines were useless without cards imported from the United
  States.

> Dehomag had sold an unprecedented 237 percent of its 1933 quota---outpacing
  all IBM foreign operations combined.

> Financial battling between Berlin and New York seemed endless. Heidinger
  continuously tried to extract bits of compensation and sometimes trivial sums
  of expense money.

> “The determination of Jewish descent will not be difficult because membership
  in the Jewish faith and membership in the Jewish culture were nearly
  identical before the emancipation of the Jews. It is therefore sufficient to
  check the change of de-nominations in church registers and registry offices
  for the last 130 years.”

> A court ruled that husbands were not legally bound to pay for purchases their
  wives made at Jewish stores.

> The Law for the Protection of German Blood and a companion decree entitled
  the Reich Citizenship Law deprived Jews of their German citizenship and now
  used the term explicitly—Jew, not non-Aryan. Moreover, Jews were proscribed
  from marrying or having sexual relations with any Aryan. Jewish employers
  could not even hire an Aryan woman under the age of 45---a concession to
  Streicher’s hysteria regarding sexual perversion. The laws would apply not
  only to full Jews, but also to half and quarter Jews as well, all according
  to complex racial mathematics.

> A firm was labeled “Jewish” if the owner or a partner was Jewish, if even a
  single Jew were in management or on the board of directors. If a quarter of
  its shares or votes were held by Jews, or under Jewish influence through
  nominees or agents, the company was classed Jewish; this regulation made it
  increasingly difficult and dangerous to mask ownership. A company could be
  owned and operated by undisputed Aryans, but if it maintained a branch
  managed by a Jew, that branch would be declared Jewish.

> In most cases, the installation of IBM machinery was mandatory in order to
  comply.

> “Jews must learn to break with their past behavior and leave public places in
  Germany to the Germans.”

> just before Christmas 1934, Watson extravagantly announced a Yule gift---a 37
  percent minimum wage increase for 7,000 workers.

> The Merit Cross of the German Eagle with Star was created for Thomas Watson
  to “honor foreign nationals who made themselves deserving of the German
  Reich.” It ranked second in prestige only to Hitler’s German Grand Cross.

> Watson had already declared that after the Berlin gathering he would travel
  to Italy for a private meeting with Mussolini and that the next conference
  scheduled for 1939 would be held in Tokyo, Germany’s Pacific ally. IBM had
  been cultivating a thriving business in Japan, helping that nation develop
  its air force and aircraft carriers.

> “If you do not agree with everything he does, cooperate with him in the
  things you do believe in. Others will cooperate with him in the things they
  believe in.”

> Presumably the letter could be exhibited with the same flourish Watson
  employed in displaying other letters to and from world leaders, some of which
  he routinely carried in his inside suit pocket.

> an August 17, 1938, regulation compelling all identified Jews whose names did
> not “sound Jewish” to add the first name Israel or Sara.

> Local prosecutors could order compulsory divorces of Jews and Aryans.

> The suicides began. Thirty per day in Prague. In Chicago, a number of Czech
  refugees who had been admitted on temporary visas formed a “suicide colony.”
  One member of the colony was Mrs. Karel Langer, who ended her family’s life
  in the Congress Hotel. First she hurled her two young boys, six and four
  years of age, out of the window of the thirteenth floor. She leapt after them
  just seconds later. Police recovered all three bodies from the Michigan
  Avenue sidewalk.

> Census takers were cautioned to overcome any distrust by assuring families
  that the information would not be released to the financial authorities.

> In late 1939, with Thomas Watson’s consent, an international training school
  for IBM service engineers throughout Europe was opened in Berlin.

> the ICC asked “the governments of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United
  Kingdom and the United States... each collaborate with their own leading
  businessmen... with respect to national needs... [and therefore] give all
  countries of the world a fair opportunity to share in the resources of the
  world.”

> For countries in the global north...

> But these methods were too sporadic and too inefficient to quickly destroy
  millions of people.

> Their favorite sport was pouncing on defenseless, pious Jews walking the
  streets and demonstratively cutting off their beards. Other times, they
  forced Jews down on all fours and then ordered neighbors to ride them like
  donkeys in a race. Brutality to Jews on holy days or just before the Sabbath
  was the most intense. Pork and butter were smeared across their lips to
  violate their kosher observance. Soldiers snapped endless photos of the
  merriment for keepsakes.

> The Bible itself taught that unless specifically ordered by God, the census
  is evil because through it the enemy will know your strength:

> Now the Reich knew exactly how many Jews were under their jurisdiction, how
  much nutrition to allocate---as low as 184 calories per person per day.

> Dehomag itself was in charge of all MB office training, leasing, upkeep, and
> custom-printed punch cards and design of specialized applications.

> Were there no female employees?

> “World Peace through World Trade.”

> Through its persistent, aggressive, unfaltering efforts, IBM virtually put
  the “blitz” in the krieg for Nazi Germany.

> A Gallup poll taken shortly after the Reich’s spring offensive began showed
  only 2 percent of Americans felt Hitler’s invasion of Belgium or Holland
  could be justified.

> Hollerith made the trains run on time in Nazi Europe.

> In the fourth quarter of 1942 alone, the German Army paid CEC 9.4 million
  French francs---equal to about $ 100,000—for leasing, service, spare parts,
  and punch cards.

> In fact, to meet Dehomag’s increasing demand, Watson in 1941 approved the
  construction of two new factory sites.

> Lentz would be the man to deliver the Jews of Holland. His motto was “to
  record is to serve.”

> British diplomats reported that in one town, when the burgomaster ordered
  Jews to affix the star, many non-Jews wore one as well.

> Holland had Lentz. France had Carmille. Holland had a well-entrenched
  Hollerith infrastructure. France’s punch card infrastructure was in complete
  disarray. The final numbers: Of an estimated 140,000 Dutch Jews, more than
  107,000 were deported, and of those 102,000 were murdered---a death ratio of
  approximately 73 percent. Of an estimated 300,000 to 350,000 Jews living in
  France, both zones, about 85,000 were deported---of these barely 3,000
  survived. The death ratio in France was approximately 25 percent.

> Carter was also looking into a category of crimes loosely styled “trading
  with the enemy.” He understood that foiling the commercial and technologic
  infrastructure of the Axis powers was as important as deploying tanks and
  troops.

> A so-called “Proclaimed List” of blacklisted companies had grown from 1,800
  in the summer of 1941 to 5,000 European and Latin American companies by
  mid-January 1942.

> In fact, since IBM only leased the machines, every Dehomag machine, whether
  deployed at the Waffen-SS office in Dachau or an insurance office in Rome,
  was considered American property to be protected. Hence, Dehomag could
  simultaneously exist as a U.S. interest and a tool of the Nazis doing
  business with the same Farben and Siemens entities that brought other
  American companies utter denunciation and often prosecution.

> Alleging treacherous business when the firm was as prominent as IBM, and its
  leader as well connected to the White House as Watson, was not to be
  undertaken lightly by any branch of the U.S. government.

> His emphasis was how IBM could not just lease products but actually control
  its customers.

> By 1943, eventually two-thirds of IBM’s entire factory capacity had shifted
  from tabulators to munitions.

> Many of these units were commanded and serviced by employees on leave. They
  formed a cohesive group of troops, affectionately called “IBM Soldiers,” with
  distinct loyalties to their company and Watson.

> Watson appointed IBM General Manager Nichol head of this department.
  Ironically, Nichol was at the same time overseeing IBM’s foreign operations
  in Nazi Europe.

> Within ninety days of Pearl Harbor, Watson was able to inform the media that
  IBM had secured more than $150 million in munitions and other defense
  contracts. Total wartime sales and rentals tripled from approximately $46
  million annually in 1940 to approximately $ 140 million annually by 1945.

> Within forty-eight hours, the Bureau of the Census published its first report
  on Japanese Americans entitled Japanese Population of the United States, Its
  Territories and Possessions. The next day it published Japanese Population by
  Nativity and Citizenship in Selected Cities of the United States. On December
  10, it released a third report, Japanese Population in the Pacific Coast
  States by Sex, Nativity and Citizenship, by Counties. Using IBM applications,
  the Census Bureau had tracked the racial ancestry of Japanese Americans based
  on their responses to the 1940 census.

> Since only 135,430 Japanese Americans lived in the United States, the results
  were tabulated quickly. A single sort was necessary: race.

> Divulging specific addresses was illegal. So the Census Bureau provided
  information that located Japanese-American concentration within specific
  census tracts. Census tracts were geographic areas generally yielding 4,000
  to 8,000 citizens. When necessary, the Census Bureau could provide even finer
  detail: so-called “enumeration districts,” and in some cities “census
  blocks.” With this information, the American government could focus its
  search in select communities along the West Coast---even if it did not have
  the exact names and addresses.

> American and Dutch census bureaus simultaneously used Hollerith systems in
  1943 to create racial “dot maps” as a means of organizing transfers to
  concentration camps.

> If locating the Japanese by census block was insufficient, the Census Bureau
  was willing to take the next step to deliver actual names and addresses.
  “We’re by law required to keep confidential information by individuals,”
  Census Director Capt declared at the time. He added, “But in the end, [i]f
  the defense authorities found 200 Japs missing and they wanted the names of
  the Japs in that area, I would give them further means of checking
  individuals.”

> This [World War] is a conflict of warlike nationalistic states, each having
  certain interests. Yet we frequently find these interests clashing
  diametrically with the opposing interests of international corporate
  structures, more huge and powerful than nations.
