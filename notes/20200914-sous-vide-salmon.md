# Sous Vide Salmon

## 2020.09.14

Sous vide went well, but skin didn't crisp up as nicely as I would've liked.
Probably more heat and time on the sear? Also only dry-brined the flesh side of
the salmon, and should've done all the sides.

## [Sous Vide Salmon][chef-steps]

- Equipment:
  - Sous vide setup
  - Ziplock-style bag (1 gallon)
- Timing: About 40 min
- Yield: 2 servings

### Ingredients

- 2 Salmon, filets, skin on
- Salt, as needed
- Sugar, optional, as needed
- Olive oil, as needed
- Black pepper, as needed

### Directions

1. Preheat Joule

  Heat water to 50 °C.

  CHEF’S TIP: This is about the same temperature as the warmest setting on most
  sink faucets. If you start with the hottest water possible, you’ll be able to
  bring the water up to temperature quickly.

1. Score (optional)

  Lay filets skin-side up on your work surface. With a sharp knife, cut several
  parallel slits through the skin, stopping when you reach the flesh. This step
  is optional, but it will help the skin get nice and crispy when you sear.

1. Dry-cure (optional)

  Sprinkle salt and sugar all over the filets, using roughly one part sugar for
  every four parts salt. Let sit for about 10 minutes, then rinse off with cold
  water. Dry-curing will firm up your fish and give it a deeper flavor.

1. Cook fish

  Add a generous amount of oil to a quart- or gallon-sized ziplock-style bag.
  Fish filets have a tendency to stick together in the bag; the oil will help
  prevent this.

  Place filets in the bag. Add salt, pepper, and the spices and aromatics of
  your choice—make sure to finely grind or mince them so they don’t “stamp”
  that pretty fish.

  Lower bag into water until fish is completely submerged, and then clip the
  bag to the side of the pot.

  Cook time will vary based on the size of your fish. Inch-thick filets should
  cook in about 40 minutes, while half-inch filets should cook in 30. We leave
  1.5-inch salmon filets in the water for an hour.

  When fish is cooked, gently roll back or cut off the seal or “zipper” of your
  ziplock-style bag to make sure you don’t snag those pretty filets. Gently
  transfer them to a plate, skin side up.

1. Sear

  Now, wait until the pan is really hot—to test heat, flick a few drops of
  water into the pan. If they sizzle, it’s time to sear, so add some oil.

  Gently flip filets into the pan so that the skin side is facing down. (We
  sear only on that side.) Let brown about 30 seconds to a minute without
  disturbing—once the skin is crispy, the fish will easily slide out of the pan
  without sticking.

1. Serve

  Carefully transfer each filet to a plate, and serve.

- Yield: Serves 4
- Active time: 15 minutes
- Total time: About 1 hour 15 minutes or up to overnight

### Ingredients

- 4 salmon fillets (5 to 6 ounces; 140 to 170g each)
- Kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil 
- Aromatics such as fresh thyme, dill, parsley, thinly sliced shallots, and/or citrus zest (optional)
- 2 teaspoons (10ml) vegetable oil, if serving seared

### Directions

1. Season salmon generously with salt on all sides.

1. Place salmon in a single layer in a gallon-size zipper-lock bag, or in
   batches in quart-size bags. Add olive oil to bag or divide it between the
   smaller bags. Add aromatics to bags, if using. Close bags, place in
   refrigerator, and let salmon rest for at least 30 minutes or up to
   overnight.

1. Using your precision cooker, preheat a water bath according to the chart
   above. Remove the air from the zipper-lock bags using the water displacement
   method: Seal bag almost all the way, leaving about an inch open. Slowly
   lower bag into water bath, holding the opened end above the water level. As
   bag is lowered, the water pressure should force air out of it. Just before
   it is totally submerged, seal bag completely. Use a rack, or clip bag to the
   side of cooking vessel using a binder clip, to prevent it from moving
   excessively. Cook 30 to 45 minutes for fillets 1 inch thick or less, or 45
   minutes to an hour for fillets between 1 and 2 inches.

1. Carefully remove salmon from bags (it will be very delicate) and transfer to
   a double layer of paper towels. Discard aromatics and gently blot top of
   salmon with more paper towels.

1. To Serve Immediately: Carefully peel away skin and discard. Serve salmon
   immediately with the freshly skinned side down for better presentation.

1. To Serve Cold: Transfer salmon to refrigerator uncovered and allow it to
   chill completely. Store in a sealed container for up to a few days and serve
   cold in sandwiches or salads, stirred into pasta, or on top of rice bowls.

1. To Sear: Heat vegetable oil in a cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick
   skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Carefully add salmon skin
   side down and cook, pressing gently on fillets with the back of a flexible
   fish spatula to help maintain pan contact, until skin is browned and crisp,
   1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Carefully flip and cook for an additional 15 seconds.
   Transfer to paper towels to blot off excess oil, then serve immediately.
