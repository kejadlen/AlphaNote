# Coyle's

We had tried to go over the weekend, only to discover it was closed for
renovations until today. We weren't planning on stopping by since we weren't
sure whether it was closed *until* or *through* the 11th, but we happened to be
driving by and saw that it was actually open.

- **Millionaire's Shortbread**: Nice components, but too much caramel:shortbread
  ratio.
- **Hazelnut Croissant**: Very nice - liked it more than [[Rosellini]]'s almond
  croissant, but haven't had [[Bakery Nouveau]]'s in a while, so jury's out on
  that one.
- **Croissant-Pretzel?**: A fun twist, but a croissant in pretzel shape loses out
  on the best parts of both breads. Better individually than mashed up.
