# Frelard Tamales

Not as amazing as I had expected from what I had been told, but still quite
good and worth it. Happy to support a gay, family-owned business that does
right by their employees and customers.

- **Sweet Piña**
- **Jalapeño & Cheese**
- **Sweet Corn**
- **Spinach & Cheese**

All were solid, but I especially enjoyed the pineapple tamale. As much as I
like corn, that one was a tad too sweet for me, but Lydia liked it -
reminiscent of a corn muffin. Five tamales was too ambitious - two savory and
one sweet would probably be about right for the two of us in the future. I'm
also interested in buying a batch of frozen ones instead for easy meals at home
in the future.
