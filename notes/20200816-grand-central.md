# Grand Central Bakery

## 2020.09.05

- **Cheddar Egg Biscuit**: A more manageable size than the PCC breakfast
  biscuit, and better cheese as well.

- **Cheddar Egg Biscuit**: Classic. We like to eat this as a half-biscuit and
  an open-faced sandwich.
- **Croissant**: It's on the less butter-y side, and a good size (not too big).
- **Raspberry Honey Muffin**: Forgot I don't love raspberries in muffins,
  though the honey was nice. A little too cake-y. Maybe try the blueberry
  muffin next time.
- **Almond Croissant**: Good balance between the almond and the croissant. Not
  as overwhelming as Bakery Nouveau.
- **Pesto and Cheese Twice-Baked Croissant**: Similar to the almond croissant,
  but savory. Good balance.
- **Chocolate Chip Cookie**: Good, but thinner and gooier than I'd prefer.
