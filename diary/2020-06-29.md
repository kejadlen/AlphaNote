Read through [Robin Sloan's video game development diary][robinsloan], on
[@LeftSaidTim][leftsaidtim]'s recommendation. Good stuff.

The second time that "Gesamtkunstwerk" has come up recently. (The other time in
the amazing [Perfect PokéRap][perfect-pokerap].)

His description of the pain of waiting for text in video games is spot on.
Whenever there's text that fades in, I'm constantly mashing whatever button
speeds it up. An unpleasant experience, especially when I accidentally
re-trigger the dialogue again.

On a similar note, I've been watching [James Hoffman's YouTube
channel][james-hoffman] recently, and appreciating his unapologetic and
straightforward assessment of how "nice" something is. I've come to realize
that this feeling is actually important to me, and is one of the reasons that I
am so invested in the Mac ecosystem. (As well as a driver of building tooling
for myself.)
